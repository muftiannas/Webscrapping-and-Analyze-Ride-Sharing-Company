# Webscrapping and Analyze Ride Sharing Company

Zuber is a new ride-sharing company launched in Chicago. The aim of this project is to find patterns in the available information. And understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on trips.
Using the database, we will analyze data from competitors and test hypotheses related to the effect of weather on trip frequency. In addition, a hypothesis test was also carried out which stated that the trip duration changed on rainy Saturdays.

To achieve the project objectives, the following steps were taken:
1. Web scraping weather data in Chicago in November 2017
2. Explorative Data Analysis (SQL)
3. Test the hypothesis that the trip duration changes on rainy Saturdays (SQL)
4. Explorative Data Analysis
5. Test the hypothesis
